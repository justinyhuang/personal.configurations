we need to do the following:
    v change the header file name from 'debug.h' to 'common_debug.h'
    v implement the _init function for the CHECKPOINT library 
    x change the insert_debug tool to produce the ID with new layout
    - implement a mechanism in the decoder tool to first separate CHECKPOINT data from different clusters: different
    cores might be running images of different endianness
    - implement the endianness handling to the decode tool
    - implement the package id to the insert_debug tool
    - implement corresponding changes in the decoder tool
    - test it and measure the performance

    ---pre review---
    - consider change checkpoint.h to hptrace.h ??
    - consider eliminating checkpointNames.list.h
    - consider eliminating checkpointSrcs.h
    - consider removing upid.h

    ------not sure list----
    - implement the secure function in the library
    - implement the mechanism to feed the UPID to the build system
    v implement the mechanism to send special CHECKPOINTs
    v implement the mechanism to produce shorter RPID for super packages
    v implement the CHECKPOINT function with the RID (Registration ID)
    v implement the interface to define and reference the RID for a package/process
    v implement the registration function in the library
    - there is still some defect in the rpid, in the test case it is 0x40, which is not currect
