this null pointer issue triggers the assert at line 1881 of videopwm_tux module.
it is associated with the cr, 382622, that can be reproduced (not all the time) by printing A5 jobs.
it is also associated with another CR, 381369, that has something to do with USB print and then cancel

this is actually a punt, when video sees a TOP when we are still printing the current page.
i think with this punt we should be aborting but somehow it keeps on printing
