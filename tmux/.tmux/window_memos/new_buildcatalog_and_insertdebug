    v implement a mechanism in the decoder tool to first separate CHECKPOINT data from different clusters: different cores might be running images of different endianness
        x reasons to move the endianness handling to the insert_debug tool:
            - once the debuglist is generated, all decoding effort will not need to spend time to handle endianness
        v reasons that we need to move the endianness handling to the decoder tool:
            - even though the debuglist file can be generated so that the ID's are endianness awared, the data in the
            CHECKPOINT is not. so we will need to manipulate the data, and the IDs, in the decoder
    v implement the endianness handling to the decode tool
    - implement the package id to the insert_debug tool
      - implementing shared memory and synchronization in the insert_debug tool, i am now stuck at synchronization
      among multi cores. boost mutex doesn't seem to work in SMP
      - need also to implement the package ID
    - implement corresponding changes in the decoder tool
