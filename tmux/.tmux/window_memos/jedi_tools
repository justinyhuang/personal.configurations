investigating the Jedi tools to generate CHECKPOINT IDs into the auto-gen header files
    - tokenanalyzer.py
        this is not the generator, will look into it later
    - tokenize.py
        the function, __generateTokenDirective() seems to be the place where we will put our floating point hack in.
            this function belongs to the Token class
        identifyFloatingPointData() is the function i wrote to identify the floating point data in the CHECKPOINT
        i removed tailing semi-columns
        i removed some unnecessary str() calls
