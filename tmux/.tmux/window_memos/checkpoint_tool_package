much work need to be done for this tool:
    v how the debuglist can be generated?
    v how about the layout of the CHECKPOINT ID?
    v how to read the library ID when building a package?
      we will first change the tool so that it generates debuglist files for every compilation units, and the we will
      combine all the debuglist files together.

    x how to configure the makefile so that we only process the files that need/have checkpoints?
      once a package has CHECKPOINT enabled all the files being built will be scanned.
    - how to generate string checkpoints
    - how to configure the debug levels
    - need Michael's input
